# Upload Files to GEO

This tutorial guides you through the process of uploading files to GEO for publication.

Please refer to [**Submitting high-throughput sequence data to GEO**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/seq.html) for detailed instructions. All the code is run in Linux.

## Steps for Submission

1. Complete **Steps 1 to 4** and **Step 6** as outlined in the guide. Step 5 is optional and not necessary for this process.
2. For **Step 7**, follow the provided link to either log in to your existing account or create a new one. Upon successful account creation or login, you will encounter a screen similar to the following:

    Next, select **Transfer Files**. You will find the FTP server credentials displayed.

    Modify the `run.lftp` file as needed and place it in the parent directory. Execute the transfer with the following command:

    ```bash
    nohup lftp -f ../run.lftp > ../run.lftp.out &
    ```

    Check the `run.lftp.out` file for any errors that may have occurred during the transfer.

   To verify the successful upload of your files, follow these steps:
   (1) Open a terminal and connect to the FTP server using the command: `ftp ftp-private.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov`. Ensure that the host address matches the one provided in your FTP server credentials.
   
   (2) When prompted, enter the username and password as indicated in your FTP server credentials.
   
   (3) Once logged in, navigate to your personalized upload directory with: `cd path_to_your_dir`. Replace `path_to_your_dir` with the actual path to your directory.
   
   (4) Check the presence of your files in this directory to confirm they've been uploaded successfully.

   Note that the log in times out after 30 sec, so make sure you have the password ready in your clipboard. Also, the server times out after 60 sec so make sure you do these commands right after another or youâ€™ll have to start all over.

4. Upload the metadata. Note that when setting the release date, a general guideline is to choose a date 1 or 2 years from the present. This can be adjusted later if necessary.
5. Upon completing your submission, you will be directed to a confirmation page and will receive a confirmation email. Additionally, expect an email from GEO curators containing your GEO accession numbers or posing questions regarding your submission.
